# 🌐 WEB DEVELOPMENT

## 📌 What is Web Development?
Basically Web Development is a process of building and maintaining websites and web applications.
Web Development involves designing, coding, deploying, and maintaining a website or application.

## 📌 Types of Web Development?
a. Frontend Development.
--> Frontend Development works on Client side.
--> Focus on UI/UX design by using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
--> Frontend Development is a part of website that users interact with directly.
--> Frontend Development uses framework like React, Angular and Vue.js.
b. Backend Development.
--> Backend Development works on Server side.
--> Backend Development manages data, authentication and business logic using Nodejs Expressjs and database.
--> Example of Backend frameworks are;
               For Python-- Django,Flask,FastAPI.
               For Javascript/Typescript-- Expressjs Nodejs Nestjs Koajs.
               For Java-- Springboot,Micronaut.
c. Full Stack Web Development.
--> Full Stack Web Development is a combination of both frontend and backend technologies.

## 📌 Key Components of  Web Development?
a. Frontend Development.
b. Backend Development.
c. Database.
--> Database stores and manages data for the website or application.
--> Database can be SQL based which include MYSQL, Postgre SQL) or NoSQL based which include MongoDB.
d. Version Control.
--> Version Control helps in tracking and managing changes.
--> Version Control includes Git, Github.

## 📌 Workflow of a Full Stack Web Development Project?
1. Requirement Gathering & Planning.
--> It includes:
                  Understand the goal of the project.
                  Identify features: login/signup, dashboard, payments, etc.
                  Decide tech stack (e.g., MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js OR MySQL + Express + React + Node.js).
2. Design & Architecture
--> It includes:
          Create wireframes/UI design using Figma/Canva.
          Define database schema (ERD diagrams: users, products, orders, etc.).
          Plan API routes (REST or GraphQL).
          Decide folder structure:
project/
├── backend/
├── frontend/
├── database/
└── docs/

3. Frontend Development (Client-Side)
--> Frontend Development includes:
                  Choosing the  framework (React, Angular, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS).
                  Build UI components (Navbar, Forms, Product Cards, etc.).
                  Implement routing (React Router for SPAs).
                  Connect to backend APIs using fetch / axios.
                  Handle state management (Redux, Context API, etc.).
4. Backend Development (Server-Side)
--> Backend Development includes:
                    Set up Node.js + Express (or Django, Spring Boot, etc.).
                    Configure API routes.
                    Add authentication (JWT, sessions).
                    Implement business logic (e.g., order total calculation).
                    Connect to database (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
5. Database Design
--> Database Design includes:
             Create tables/collections that includes Users, Products, Orders, Messages,
             Define relationships (1-to-many, many-to-many).
             Write queries (SQL/NoSQL).
             Implement validation and indexing.
6. Integration (Frontend + Backend + DB)
--> Integration includes:
                Frontend sends requests → Backend processes → Database stores data.
--> Example workflow:
                          User clicks "Sign Up" → frontend form → POST /signup API.
                          Backend validates + stores in DB.
                          Response sent back to frontend → show success/failure.
7. Testing
--> Testing includes:
                       Unit Testing: test functions/components individually.
                       Integration Testing: check frontend-backend connection.
                       User Acceptance Testing (UAT): ensure features work as expected.
8. Deployment
--> Deployment includes:
                       Frontend: Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or static hosting.
                       Backend: Deploy to Railway, Render, AWS, or Heroku.
                       Database: Hosted on MongoDB Atlas, MySQL Railway, or AWS RDS.
                       Configure environment variables (.env for secrets).
9. Monitoring & Maintenance
--> Monitoring & Maintenance includes:
                    Use logging & monitoring tools (Winston, Morgan, Datadog).
                    Collect user feedback.
                    Fix bugs, update features.
                    Apply security patches (sanitize inputs, update dependencies).

Summary of Workflow of Full Stack Web Development:
-->  Plan → Design → Frontend → Backend → Database → Integration → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
